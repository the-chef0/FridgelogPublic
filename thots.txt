linked list justification:

Don't know memory requirements beforehand
O(1) prepend time and easy prepend when adding items
O(1) add time if we decide to quickly add into sorted linkedlist?
Easy deletion with O(n) worst case complexity
Random access is O(n) in worst case but will have to traverse the whole list when printing it out anyway
Random access in O(n) is not tragic anyway because we can expect a relatively low number of items
Sort in O(n log(n))
